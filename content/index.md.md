Hey reader, How are you? Hope you are in a good place, and doing good. I am so elated to announce that I am hosting this platform, and you can see it online, without any third-party stuff, I know, third-parties are there (medium, hashnode, etc.), but I don't care, you will see crap there, but here, its only you and me, you will read my thoughts, no one can stop me, thanks to obsidian and quartz. You can read all my thoughts/contents here, no one is stopping you and me. You can see about me at [my-portfolio](tausiqsama.me). Expectations: anything, but for percentage game: 40% my thoughts, 60% science and tech related. My unbiased opinions and thoughts are here. 

Hope, you have a good read.
