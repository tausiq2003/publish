### DSA
- Longest Subarray with sum k (positives).
- Longest Subarray with sum k(positives + negative) (using hashmap).
- Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum subarray)
- Dutch National Flag Algorithm ( Sort colors).
- Moore's Voting Algorithm (Majority Element (>n/2)).
Not writing much about this as those are algorithms and I will write about those in a second blog a compilation of all algorithms as I will learn.


### Project
- Finally figured out, how to find eval bar value, accuracy and elo estimation.
- Will test this out tomorrow.
