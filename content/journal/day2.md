### DSA
- Intersection of two sorted arrays
	- Solve by #two-pointer approach. Keep pointer i at a, pointer j at b, make a new array for inserting, if ith element < jth element, then increment i, if ith element > jth element, increment j.
	- if both are equal then check if the last element is the element that is being to be inserted, if it is then ignore, else insert it.
- Missing number.
	- Find the sum of the whole array.
	- Subtract with sum till 1-n.
	- return result.
- Maximum consecutive ones.
	- Solve by #two-pointer approach (Tags are added because it will create a nice graph).
	- Keep one count and other max.
	- Count when ones are found.
	- If max > count then, update max.
	- Return max.
### Project
- Read about UCI notation and how to use it.
- Still finding how to do the eval bar the formulae for that.
- Looking up various engines and src code.


Was little busy, so can't do computer networks. Hope I will work hard tomorrow and make major progress. 

Thanks.
