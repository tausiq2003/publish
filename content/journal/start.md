So, from 7/7/2025, i will start posting my daily learnings on social media. It could be anything. Anything from small to big, but i will post it everyday, if I  miss one day, I will delete all my social media, and drop from CS, i won't do CS anymore, I will do something ordinary, I don't know what I will do. Bullshit, yeah, I will do DSA, projects, here are my project ideas -> chess-analyze(half done), maillater(most frontend done), other one is undecided, i have in mind. And learn core subjects. If I can't do anything for a day or forget to post, just tag me I will delete all socials and leave CS for rest of my life. This is not yapping. I will do it. Doesn't matter what it takes. The hashtag will be #xdaystilligetjob (x-days-till-i-get-job), i don't care who is doing it, i don't care if you curse me. I believe in God. And I will achieve it. Last time, i left 100DaysofCode at 69 days. My socials are fucked up, can't network with people, because i was busy learning stuff, react, ts, js, next, express, backend, postgres, sql, and I admit, I went too far (rabbit hole) without showing up, thats my fault. But not from tomorrow. I will come back. Else I will leave this shit, forever (after that i request all my followers unfollow me, block me). So, enough yapping, i will post from tomorrow. I will post daily updates here. If you like my posts and journals, then please like. 

Thanks.
